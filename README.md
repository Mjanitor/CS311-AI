CS311 Artificial Intelligence

Contained inside are two java applications and five text files.  

The two java applications, "dataGather.java" and "partyGuesser.java" will, respectively, gather user training data to populate a supervised training algorithm to weight answers to a political philosophy quiz versus what political party they most closely identify with.  The partyGuesser application will then reference that data and generate a quiz for a user.  The user will then answer that quiz one question at a time.  If at any point the algorithm determines that it's confident enough to predict a political party for the user, it will end the program and output its guess.

The five text files are the questions that are prompted to the user and the local storage/weights of real user input. (I would have gathered more, but there's only so much you can do when asking people for free.)
